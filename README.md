# Graph Visualization Project

A Graph Visualization Application that is made as the Project of Group 4 in CS1105 2022-26 at IET, JKLU.

The applications features Visualizations of Graph Algorithms- Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search. It uses Colours and Arrows to signify the current state and actions of the Algorithm, along with the appropriate Data Structure used.
